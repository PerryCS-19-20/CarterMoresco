                May I have your attention please?
                Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
                I repeat will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
                Were going to have a problem here

                Yall act like you never seen a white person before
                Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
                Started whoopin her worse than before, they first get divorced
                Throwing her over furniture
                Its the return of the Oh wait, no way, your kidding,
                He didnt just say what I think he did, did he?
                And Dr Dre said
                Nothing you idiots Dr Dres dead, hes locked in my basement (ha ha)
                Feminist women love Eminem, chicka chicka chicka Slim Shady I'm sick of him
                Look at him, walking around grabbing his you know what
                Flippin the you know who yeah, but hes so cute though
                Yea I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
                But no worse than whats going on in your parents bedrooms
                Sometimes I want to get on TV and just let loose, but can't,
                But its cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
                My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
                And if Im lucky you might just give it a little kiss
                And thats the message that we deliver to little kids
                And expect them not to know what a womens is.
                Of course they gonna know what intercourse is, by the time they hit 4th grade,
                They got the discovery channel dont they?
                We aint nothing but mammals,
                Well some of us cannibals, who cut other people open like cantaloupes.
                But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
                Then theres no reason that a man and another man can't elope
                But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote.
                Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

                And I don't gotta be false or sugar coat it at all
                I just get on the mic and spit it, and whether you like to admit it (rip)
